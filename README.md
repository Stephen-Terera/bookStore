# bookStore
Python book management system. This was part of a short Udemy course I did to help sharpen my Python skills. I used to the course to learn more about 
how to make GUI python applications.The project uses a database to store all the information on a particular book. The user then has several options which
include adding a new book, searching for one and display one or many books. It is as simple project and makes uses for tkinter to make the GUI application.
